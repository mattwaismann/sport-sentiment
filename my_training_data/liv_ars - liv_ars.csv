931,2019-10-30 20:02:46,The commentator here just said that apparently they can use VAR in this cup if the home team is playing in the PL (as such they will have the required tech installed). Is that bullshit or true?,
932,2019-10-30 20:03:01,"Unrelated but how fucking shit is the chat on the side of streams. I always disable it but when the stream forces an add you catch a glimpse and it's just people spoiling the score, pretending there's been a goal and the occasional ""fuck Salah, cmon man u""",

337,2019-10-30 20:03:11,Lallana looks really good as a 6. Has recovered the ball a lot in this game,
1185,2019-10-30 20:03:12,Hmm I don’t care but then yet again I want to win because it’s Arsenal.,

2281,2019-10-30 20:03:55,Gómez has been our best player in the defence this game which is at least a promising sign,

2428,2019-10-30 20:04:29,Is there anything wrong with Keita? he doesn't look fit,
278,2019-10-30 20:04:41,Keita needs to get involved more given he's one of the senior players here. It's not working for Ox at the minute but at least he's being busy.,
2282,2019-10-30 20:04:45,Im pretty happy with how the match has gone so far Edit: considering our lineup,
1865,2019-10-30 20:04:58,Let’s be real no matter what the result is it’s a win win for us. If we win then it’s great to see the kids plus some others doing well. If we lose then we don’t have to worry about the fixture congestion advancing would create,

1423,2019-10-30 20:06:49,I think the biggest mistake here is not having any true first team players on the bench.,

1919,2019-10-30 20:07:37,Good lord,
1920,2019-10-30 20:07:40,Just dumb from Elliott,

732,2019-10-30 20:07:57,Can’t believe people are scapegoating Kelleher here. He should do better for the second goal but the first isn’t on him and everyone is playing so bad.,

2323,2019-10-30 20:07:57,Why do we hate this cup?,
1786,2019-10-30 20:07:58,2 offside goals to be fair,

686,2019-10-30 20:08:15,get a fucking grip some of you. It's a CARABAO CUP match for fuck sake,
2244,2019-10-30 20:08:18,The space in the box is just unreal for Arsenal. We really have no good backup fullbacks.,

1137,2019-10-30 20:08:53,match thread turned toxic the second we started losing. cmon guys did you expect some sort of masterclass from the “Melwood Pick n mix” as another commenter said.,
1194,2019-10-30 20:08:57,Well that's a wrap. Was nice shitposting with you guys.,
474,2019-10-30 20:09:01,"Some (possibly) slightly unpopular opinions:

1. Lallana has looked great and still has a lot to offer this team. 
2. Ox and Keita have plenty of underwhelming games and those who call for them to replace Henderson in the starting 11 probably just look at the two of them favorably because they typically come on late in matches where the opponent is tired so their impact is exaggerated.",

1829,2019-10-30 20:09:02,"My only takeaways so far are that this lot can't defend, and that Arsenal may have the most annoying fans. They're treating a League Cup tie against kids as if it's a North London derby cup final.",

2371,2019-10-30 20:09:08,Lallana is winning and holding the ball great but he needs to get it moving quicker. Maybe his options are limited but he's slowing us down.,
396,2019-10-30 20:09:10,I love all the people in this thread asserting that a bunch of teenagers aren't ready to displace Van Dijk or our front three. The sheer brilliance of that analysis is just overwhelming,
2245,2019-10-30 20:09:19,some of these young boys aren't playing well weighted balls. and just too timid and not physical enough.,
1788,2019-10-30 20:09:20,we've been playing mostly well but the turnovers are costing us and gomez has been poor,
1866,2019-10-30 20:09:26,Is anyone really that bothered by this? We’re playing a bunch of kids and bench players that just need some game time for match fitness against most of arsenals 1st team,
2273,2019-10-30 20:09:29,This will be a death sentence for some youth careers hoping to make it into the first team,

2445,2019-10-30 20:09:38,love too get visibly mad about losing a carabao cup game while playing our youth team 👍🏻,
2446,2019-10-30 20:09:39,dont think this kind of performance is surprising. putting this many new faces into the team how can you expect any relationships within the attack mid and defence to form. seems like everyone has their own game plan,
2447,2019-10-30 20:09:39,When Neco Williams has been one of our best players you know we’re fucked,
2370,2019-10-30 20:09:41,You can blame the kids all you want but Keita and Lallana are playing like shit,
1831,2019-10-30 20:09:42,Too many of these players are not nearly ready. This could get ugly.,
338,2019-10-30 20:09:43,Games like this really make you appreciate VvD and his effect on our defense.,

881,2019-10-30 20:40:30,"Thinking about what Ljinders was saying in that presser the other day. 'Our identity is intensity'. 

Great words and why I think Naby Keita is struggling. Just look when he misses out on that chest control there, he just sort of, flops... Takes him ages to get back up.

The lad needs to seriously up his mental game if he's going to make it here. I hope he can because he's got buckets of talent, somewhere.",

1288,2019-10-30 20:56:49,Klopp’s fuming,

242,2019-10-30 21:00:21,I reeeeaaaaallly want the lads to win this. Not because of the trophy but because i really want to see them play more and get minutes to prove themselves. Cmooon laaaads!!! YNWA!!,

Kids proved they have it in them, wouldn't be surprised if we equalized again haha",

1870,2019-10-30 21:00:28,small cock willock,
706,2019-10-30 21:00:33,Adrian should have started this game I really can’t understand why he didn’t to be honest,
1019,2019-10-30 21:00:36,"Come on Elliott lad, you might as well have one now",
883,2019-10-30 21:00:38,FUCKING LOVREN!!,

2609,2019-10-30 21:00:54,Geez,
632,2019-10-30 21:00:55,look at the amount of first-team players on their bench,
2610,2019-10-30 21:00:55,Defence is lost,
2291,2019-10-30 21:01:00,If anything this game will do well to dampen the ridiculous expectations people have about these kids and why we should sign appropriate depth.,
358,2019-10-30 21:01:01,"Sepp learning that you need to step up to attackers rather than just watch ... harsh, but a good lesson for him.",
1143,2019-10-30 21:01:04,"VDB really needs work. I get it, he's young, but he's been partly at fault for a few goals now. Basically just watched Willock get into a great shooting position.",
2261,2019-10-30 21:01:04,Some fucking bangers tonight wow.,
2262,2019-10-30 21:01:06,inb4 Elliot banger,
2292,2019-10-30 21:01:08,Henderson is invisible,
633,2019-10-30 21:01:09,We need to let them score again. A 2 goal lead is their only weakness.,

1653,2019-10-30 21:01:15,Who said this could be 6-6 at the start of the match?? It's on.,
1801,2019-10-30 21:01:15,i cant even be arsed tbh this game is amazing,
1301,2019-10-30 21:01:16,"Poor defending, nobody closing him down. Great strike though.",
1302,2019-10-30 21:01:18,Only one shot in the target in the Chelsea game and that too from penalty strike,
359,2019-10-30 21:01:28,It's kind of wild that Joe is the senior of the center back partnership,
290,2019-10-30 21:01:30,I absolutely love klopp rotating players and giving the kids a run but not sure why he hasnt put at least 1 big attacking threat on the bench,
1780,2019-10-30 21:01:32,Arsenal fans singing “you’re not singing anymore” right after you can clearly hear our fans singing after the goal,
243,2019-10-30 21:01:33,Hardly expected this game with the line ups to be this wild.,
1435,2019-10-30 21:01:33,"Ali saves that, Adrian gets a hand, kid gets fingertips. Still a nice goal.  Twat",
1802,2019-10-30 21:01:33,"Sadly even if Arsenal wins,they still have to face City at finals.",
244,2019-10-30 21:01:41,We cannot pass from the back. Too easy for Arsenal to intercept.,
15,2019-10-30 21:01:50,Wasn't arsed about the game before but pulling it back to 4-4 I'm going to be pissed if we lose now. Plus would be hilarious to knock these out.,
1654,2019-10-30 21:02:06,How’s Gomez played?,
1810,2019-10-30 21:02:15,"God damn VdB, close down your man, stop holding off every single time someone runs at you. I know the lad is young but come on.",
139,2019-10-30 21:02:22,I just want Elliott to score,
72,2019-10-30 21:02:27,It’s like watching a game of fifa,
691,2019-10-30 21:02:45,All we need left is a Brewster goal,
634,2019-10-30 21:02:55,Elliot Brewster or Jones goal please,
291,2019-10-30 21:02:56,Really only care about winning because it’d be funny after how excited they’ve been,
1303,2019-10-30 21:02:59,LMAO that roar,
1444,2019-10-30 21:03:03,"Honestly, at this point, i don't care who wins. 4 goals with this squad against Arsenal is pretty fucking good. Love to see those screamers by Ox and Origi. Wish to see some Brewster magic now! Lets go reds",
692,2019-10-30 21:03:07,"Whatever the result this has been a very entertaining game. It's been awful, amazing, infuriating, breathtaking.

9 goals already and there is still 20 minutes to play!",
707,2019-10-30 21:03:14,Is Arsenal just realizing we are playing our third keeper? and he was our 4th keeper for a time actually,
635,2019-10-30 21:03:17,The Milner Scream,
292,2019-10-30 21:03:27,"Milner has been very sloppy tonight,",
442,2019-10-30 21:03:30,"Elliott is industrious, that’s for sure. Still running the pitch as if his name was Robertson.",
1020,2019-10-30 21:03:33,Milly having a rough go,
2095,2019-10-30 21:03:38,"I feel like this is good runthrough of gamescript, practicing crosses, because I suspect any shot taken outside the box is going in, either side.",
636,2019-10-30 21:03:41,This wiĺiams lad is weirdly over-confident and it's scary yet entertaining.,
78,2019-10-30 21:03:44,Milner is playing so bad and he is so frustrated about it,
637,2019-10-30 21:03:56,"""AHHHHHH""...""you okay?""...""I'm alright""",
808,2019-10-30 21:03:59,Milner too much Ribena,
102,2019-10-30 21:04:01,"pretty clear that gomez has a lot of work to do if he's to live up to his billing as a future partner of VVD.

he's probably the most fragile of the 3 CBs on the senior team to partner with VVD.

degs makes mistakes but he's a solid veteran.

joel has weird moments too but he's become solid too.",
103,2019-10-30 21:04:08,"Get that off the screen sky, no one gives a shit what's happening at villa",
1410,2019-10-30 21:04:16,"Jones is impressing me , Williams not so much",

1655,2019-10-30 21:04:28,Everyone is Adriano on a red. Shoot and it goes in the top corner,
122,2019-10-30 21:04:29,Harvey Elliott score a goal,
693,2019-10-30 21:04:29,Milner has been so poor for his standards.,
1808,2019-10-30 21:04:29,Lallana and Milner are not having good games,
443,2019-10-30 21:04:48,I mean.. I'm entertained.,
104,2019-10-30 21:04:51,Never seen so many mistakes in a game.,
79,2019-10-30 21:05:00,Emery bringing on Lacazette. He must be rattled.,
360,2019-10-30 21:05:02,Come on lads 15 minutes to score 2,
170,2019-10-30 21:05:10,Milner has been piss poor too lmao,
1304,2019-10-30 21:05:48,Imagine if this goes to penalties. The scenes would be intense,
520,2019-10-30 21:05:49,We’ve scored as many goals as the other 4 teams playing and we’re still losing,
1854,2019-10-30 21:05:52,"I missed the Keita sub, is he injured again?",
639,2019-10-30 21:05:54,Kolasinac should be off,
2367,2019-10-30 21:06:16,"So does Arsenal not have any young players in their squad, or are they actually taking this tournament seriously? I guess they must realize that they have no chance of winning any of the big trophies.",

2096,2019-10-30 21:06:26,Is Hoever injured?,
2263,2019-10-30 21:06:36,Dear god imagine if we had sold Lovren in the summer. We'll have only Van Dijk and Gomez for the next two months.,
694,2019-10-30 21:06:39,"I still haven't seen many signs of talent from Brewster. People always call me out when I say it, but I really don't think he'll make it for us.",
884,2019-10-30 21:06:41,Arsenal are furiously sweating it out with their first team while we keep memeing our way back into the game,
1855,2019-10-30 21:06:41,Jesus Christ elliotts crossing is not great. He really needs to work on his decision making,
1305,2019-10-30 21:06:45,Van den berg needs to calm down on ball and not get nervous. Elliot needs to pass directly and not short. Williams needs better decision making although he has done well. Lallana needs to be more aware since he is playing deeper.,
2344,2019-10-30 21:06:45,"Why short freekicks when they are surrounded? I really don't understand some things we do, like playing it around defenders instead of just kicking it if it gets too dangerous. So many small mistakes this game, even Milner and Lallana are making terrible decisions.",
1306,2019-10-30 21:06:54,Ox is fking awesome,
809,2019-10-30 21:06:58,Chirivela again wtf,
361,2019-10-30 21:07:05,Elliot suffers from the Salah syndrome aka being left footed,

4d chess.",
