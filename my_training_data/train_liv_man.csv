4,"Come on, boys. These are the games you live for -- get out there and prove you've still got the right mentality. Leicester & West Ham have dropped points, fucking win this and put ourselves back in the title challenge. 

Jones starting is good. I love Millie but he was slowing us down. Jones adds some creativity and the ability to run past people, too. Mane back is big -- I've always said he's our big game player, the one who always shows up. 

Wanted Kabak to start but I understand why he wouldn't. We just miss so much with Fab and Hendo at the back, but they're both beasts there. Hendo will especially be well up for this.",0.16806054,0.0

It’s literally numbing watching them obsessing over a certain situations. Analyzing footage for 4 minutes on the most marginal of offsides, or going back and chalking off a goal because a player (who’s being mauled mind you) at the halfway line barely handles it (even though several passes and distance transpired).

But on that handball on the Salah shot, it’s eerie how quickly not only the commentators will say shit like “oh that’s part and parcel. Nothing in that”; and refs will barely even acknowledge it.
