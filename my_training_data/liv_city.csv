Edit: I just been banned from this sub for a joke comment I made in a standup comedian's subreddit - nothing to do with this sub and it is an injoke.

Why are the mods banning me for a joke they don't get in a different subreddit? They added the note 'really? Work on your etiquette.'

Talk about overreach and letting mod power go to your head. 

I would overlook that condescending bullshit if they actually took action against genuinely toxic trolls who abuse, stalk and attack people here.

You could tell with the way we struggled to play out first 20 minutes that its difficult to keep the system's fluidity when we're forced to shuffle those 5 cb/cm positions literally every game.

If Curtis finds another gear and Wijnaldum takes more risks, I really back us in the second half.

Have to say Thiago is really disappointing me and I think Hendo should move up to midfield and let Nat fill in at CB if we need to accept more risk and apply more pressure. Kabak maybe but Klopp would know best which CB is most ready.

Shaq is a good shout for more incisiveness but not sure he's physical enough.

Trent might have done better on the penalty play, but honestly it was just good running and it's even hard to fault Fab for it. I think he's done well defensively and having Curtis in a Hendo role to help track back is clearly beneficial to him.
