115,2019-10-30 19:51:10,He's off! Is there no VAR?,0
116,2019-10-30 19:51:12,VAR is at home watching this crying..so offside!,0
117,2019-10-30 19:51:13,I take it back. I wish VAR was in use,0
118,2019-10-30 19:51:17,I mean that was clearly off even without the benefit of a replay,0
119,2019-10-30 19:51:22,Do we blame Lovren for that?,0
120,2019-10-30 19:51:25,Not being mad or anything but that has to be the worst piece of defending I've ever seen from us.,0

131,2019-10-30 19:51:48,"Offside, but that was horibble defending",0
132,2019-10-30 19:51:52,Lmao offside. This is the type of shit that would fuck us in the league week in week out over the years. As much as a ball ache VAR can be it at least stops bullshit offsides.,0
133,2019-10-30 19:51:59,Such a clear offside but defense falling asleep in our own box is inexcusable,0
134,2019-10-30 19:52:07,That came from a pretty poor pass from Ox,0

140,2019-10-30 19:52:54,Ox losing balls left right.,0
141,2019-10-30 19:53:04,This cup is so shit that there is no VAR?,0
142,2019-10-30 19:53:05,Ox has been poor so far. I'm sure that will change but he has been woeful with some of his touches,0
143,2019-10-30 19:53:12,"Fucking hell just saw the replay, Torreira was at least two feet offside. Awful officiating.",0
144,2019-10-30 19:53:13,Ox has not been very good today,0

166,2019-10-30 19:56:40,"Yes, it was offside.

But that is no fucking excuse for two players to stand completely still looking at the linesman instead of closing down the attacker. Piss poor defending.",0
167,2019-10-30 19:56:41,This defence has the reactions of a fucking toaster,0
168,2019-10-30 19:56:56,Wtf is going on fuck sake,0

177,2019-10-30 19:58:45,"down vote me all you want, but Brewster has never lived up to his hype whenever he's got his chance. Always gives the ball away or sell's players short. Doesn't get himself on the ball enough either.",0
178,2019-10-30 19:58:46,Fucking hell Gomez has turned to absolute shit. What the fuck happened,0
179,2019-10-30 19:58:52,Kelleher needs to step up!,0
180,2019-10-30 19:59:31,That Lallana tackle was a thing of beauty,1
181,2019-10-30 19:59:34,Keeper has to be better there. The initial shot was going out and had no power either let it go or get on top of it. Soft hand back into danger.,0
182,2019-10-30 19:59:36,Does this sub know that this is a bunch of kids in defense? Doesn't seem like it.,0
183,2019-10-30 19:59:40,Adam Lallana you beautiful man,1

189,2019-10-30 20:00:35,Kelleher has been atrocious so far. Heavily involved in both goals especially the second.,0
190,2019-10-30 20:00:37,No var of course,0
191,2019-10-30 20:00:47,Home fans need to get behind these lads,0
192,2019-10-30 20:00:48,"Anyone one else frustrated by the bench tonight? I really think it would have been fine to have Bobby or Mane on the bench for impact. No disrespect to any of the lads on the bench but there is nothing in terms of impact from there and this team doesn't look strong enough atm.

Also think Fab should have started this and missed villa game at weekend purely on the basis of if he gets booked at weekend we wont have him against city which is crucial. Looks like he will defo start at weekend now.",0
193,2019-10-30 20:00:50,Even though he couldn't get much on it that was a filthy header by Brewster,0
194,2019-10-30 20:00:57,Why no VAR? (Not that I care),0

200,2019-10-30 20:01:33,"Hendo is horrible as always. Practically invisible.

Lovren is guilty in both goals",0
201,2019-10-30 20:01:42,Fuck off torreira,0

315,2019-10-30 20:38:10,"I just want to see one of either Brewster or Elliot score. Just to settle the nerves that we do have some young talent coming through. If we were playing all 21 yo or all rotational players I would care about this cup more, but it’s hard to take it seriously with so many teenagers getting their first senior starts against seasoned professionals. I’d like to see more loan move for Brewster next season in particular to build his confidence.",1

326,2019-10-30 20:41:05,It’s mad to think some of these kids are near the same age as Trent just shows how special he is,1
