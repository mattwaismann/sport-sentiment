### Sport Sentiment
Sport Sentiment is a NLP language model trained end-to-end on self-labeled texts pulled from Twitter and Reddit's APIs. The idea was to analyze the sentiment of Liverpool FC's fan base throughout the course of a game. 

Future plans include training the model on larger dataset, allowing for the use of sequential models like recurrent neural networks. In addition, I am working on a flask app to make this tool interactive and accessible to anyone. Stay tuned!

### Results:
Each figure represents the output of the language model throughout the course of the game. The inputs were never seen in training.
